# Flinkful

## Why Flinkful?

Flink is a popular stateful compute engine and it has provided a few ways for management such as cli, http, python and scala REPLs,  which would only satisfy some purposes and people have to choose one or  all of them for needs.

I have done some exciting work which developed generic Java flink client supporting submit jobs„ÄÅaccess cluster  and jobs status, and more features to be adding. Through it, I believed people can concern more on how to manage and maintain flink infrastructure prevent by the absence of Java client.
