# Flinkful

## Why Flinkful?

Flink is a popular stateful compute engine and it has provided a few ways for management such as cli, http, python and scala REPLs,  which would only satisfy some purposes and people have to choose one or  all of them for needs.

I have done some exciting work which developed generic Java flink client supporting submit jobs„ÄÅaccess cluster  and jobs status, and more features to be adding. Through it, I believed people can concern more on how to manage and maintain flink infrastructure prevent by the absence of Java client.

## How Flinkful?

As mentioned [here](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/deployment/overview/), Flink consists of `JobManager`, `TaskManager` and `client`. After `JobManager` bootstraped, people can access Flink cluster with runtime-webui by http, In fact, most Flink cluster and job status can be obtained by http.

Flink supports 3 deployment mode:

* Application
* Per-Job
* Session

Application and Per-Job deployment mode will create a new Flink cluster through resource providers such as YARN or Kubernetes, so Flink http api is limited on job submission.



### Job Submission



### Access cluster and job status
